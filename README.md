# XNotForMe
Not only X/Twitter has [nuked](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) all 3rd party apps, they now force a `For You` timeline filled with ads, unrelated topics, trash content and doomscrolling designed to waste your time. 

This is a quick and dirty tweak to regain your sanity and completely hide the `For You` tab in the X timeline.
The only timeline you need is the chronological one, with posts only from people you follow.

Works well for me with X v10.3.2, when also combined with [BHTwitter](https://github.com/BandarHL/BHTwitter) v4.0 to remove ads and other annoyances.

## Installation
You can compile and bundle the tweak yourself, or download a combined `.ipa` in [releases](https://github.com/n3d1117/XNotForMe/releases) which includes this tweak and BHTwitter.
